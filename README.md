Brain Buster: A Memory Matching Game

Brain Buster is a console-based memory matching game developed in Python that challenges players to uncover hidden number pairs in a grid with as few guesses as possible. 
The game supports dynamic grid sizes, allowing players to choose between 2x2, 4x4, or 6x6 grids, which are randomized at the start of each game for replayability. 
Players interact with the game through a simple menu, enabling them to test pairs of cells, reveal specific cells for hints, or restart the game. A scoring system evaluates performance
based on how efficiently pairs are uncovered, rewarding players who solve the grid in the minimum number of guesses. The project highlights Python's built-in data structures
and object-oriented programming principles, with game.py handling the interface and grid.py managing the game logic and scoring. Designed to run directly from the command line 
using Python 3.x, the game features robust error handling for invalid inputs and commands. To play, simply specify the grid size as a command-line argument, and enjoy testing
your memory in this engaging and challenging game!
